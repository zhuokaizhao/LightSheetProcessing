# LightSheetProcessing
LightSheetProcessing (LSP) is a software that processes image data captured by a light sheet fluorescence microscopy. LSP reads a number of or one specific microscopy image data file created in the Carl Zeiss CZI format, which saves image stacks, time lapse series and tile images captured from a Carl Zeiss microscope. LSP first organized them into [detached-header NRRD File format](http://teem.sourceforge.net/nrrd/format.html#general.2) and later generates PNG images as well as corresponding AVI videos based on the Maximum Intensity Projection (MIP) and Average Intensity Projection (AIP) of the input data.

## Compilation
After getting all the dependencies ready, under the main directory `LightSheetProcessing/`, run
```
sh scripts/compile.sh
```		

Note: The script is written to be run on Linux system, modifications are required if running on other platforms. By default it will add the install path `/LightSheetProcessing/LSP-INSTALL/` to your `~/.bash_profile` and `~/.profile`.

## Standard input data format
1. All files should be in the Carl Zeiss CZI format (.czi files).
2. If you want LSP to process a number of consecutive files, please put all of them under one path (for example, `~/czi/*.czi`). And name them to have the following format, note that the first (0 timestamp) should have no parentheses.
```
data_name.czi (0 timestamp data)
data_name(1).czi
data_name(2).czi
...
```

## Running
1. Run `lsp -h` to show the most general information about the program.
2. LSP includes two general processing pipelines - `lsp start` and `lsp start_with_corr`, where "corr" stands for correlation. 
- `lsp start` 
<br /> `lsp start` is the processing pipeline that **should be used when there is NO obvious specimen drift** during the experiment collecting the microscope data. Because it does not include any drift correction algorithm. More specifically, it only combines `lsp skim`, `lsp proj` and `lsp anim`, which are responsible for reading raw CZI data, generating MIP and MIA projection files, and producing final image sequences respectively. Details of these separate programs will be showed in more detail in the next section.
  - Required arguments:
    - `-c, czi_path`, path which contains all the input CZI files
    - `-n, nhdr_path`, path which will contain all the NHDR headers and XML data files generated by `lsp skim`
    - `-p, proj_path`, path which will contain all the NRRD projection files generated by `lsp proj`
    - `-a, anim_path`, path which will contain all the PNG images and AVI videos generated by `lsp anim`
  - Optional arguments:
    - `-f, fps`, frame per second (fps) of the generated AVI video, default is 10
    - `-v, verbose`, 0 for essential progress outputs only, 1 for all the printouts
  - Output formats:
    - NHDR headers and XML data files:
      <br /> All NHDR headers and XML data files will have three-digit names saved into `nhdr_path`, which correspond to their time stamps
      ```
      000.nhdr, 000.xml;
      001.nhdr, 001.xml;
      002.nhdr, 002.xml;
      ...
      ```
    - NRRD projection files:
      <br /> NRRD projection files in all three planes will be saved into `proj_path`, and will have the following format:
      ```
      000-projXY.nrrd, 000-projXZ.nrrd, 000-projYZ.nrrd;
      001-projXY.nrrd, 001-projXZ.nrrd, 001-projYZ.nrrd;
      002-projXY.nrrd, 002-projXZ.nrrd, 002-projYZ.nrrd;
      ...
      ```
    - PNG images and AVI videos:
      - All images will be saved into `anim_path`, and will have the following format, for both `average` and `max` channel:
        ```
        000-avg.png, 000-max.png;
        001-avg.png, 001-max.png;
        002-avg.png, 002-max.png;
        ...
        ```
      - All videos will be saved into `anim_path`, and will have the following format, for both `average` and `max` channel:
        ```
        avg.avi, max.avi
        ```
        If a specific `max_file_number` was entered as argument, the output videos will have names indicating the number:
        ```
        avg_max_file_number.avi, max_max_file_number.avi
        ```
      - There will also be some files ending with `.ppm` and `.nrrd` generated, but are simply the outputs generated in the middle of processing

- `lsp start_with_corr`
<br /> `lsp start_with_corr` is the processing pipeline that **should be used when there IS obvious specimen drift** during the experiment collecting the microscope data. Compared to the standard `lsp start`, it includes drift correction algorithm. More specifically, it not only combines `lsp skim`, `lsp proj` and `lsp anim`, but also includes three subprograms which are responsible for drift correction; `lsp corrimg`, `lsp corrfind` and `lsp corrnhdr`. They are used to generate images for every NRRD projection files in all three directions, calculate the best correlation results between images, and produce final new NHDR headers respectively. These new NHDR headers will then be used to generate new projection files by `lsp proj` and later images and videos by `lsp anim`. With that being said, `lsp start_with_corr` will take a lot more time than `lsp start` because it not only runs additional processings, but also runs `lsp proj` twice.

    - `-j, new_proj_path`, path which will contain all the new NRRD projection files generated by `lsp proj` with new NHDR headers in `new_nhdr_path`
    - `-a, anim_path`, path which will contain all the PNG images and AVI videos generated by `lsp anim`

3. LSP currently includes four subcommands: `lsp skim`, `lsp proj`, `lsp anim`, `lsp corrimg`, `lsp corrfind`, and `lsp corrnhdr`. Same to the general command `lsp`, each subcommand could be run to show help instructions when added `-h` flag as well.

    - There will also be some files ending with `.ppm` and `.nrrd` generated, but are simply the outputs generated during processing
